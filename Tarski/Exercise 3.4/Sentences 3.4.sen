; You can make this a sentence by adding a single
; quantifier (and variable)./w (Tet(w) $ Large(w))
; Here, too.Tet(a) $ /w Large(w)
; Since you can't add parentheses, you'll have to 
; put the quantifier in the right place./w Tet(w) $ @w Large(w)
; How many quantifiers do you need here?
; Remember, you can't add parentheses./x Large(x) $ @y@x~Larger(y, x)@x @y ((Cube(x) & Cube(y)) $ ~Larger(x, y))@x Cube(a)
; Remember, you are only to add quantifiers  or 
; variables or both.  No changing the "a".  The
; resulting sentence is odd, but we'll explain 
; what it means later.@x/y Tet(y) $ /x Small(x)
; The quantifier here is not doing anything.  It
; doesn't bind the y (wrong variable) and it
